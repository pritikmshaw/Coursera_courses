                paragraph tag
                Hi, today we're gonna talk about some of the tags that you may find extremely useful
                <br>
                 as you go and try to add blocks of code and simple snippets of different things to your web page. I know that it can seem overwhelming how many tags there are in HTML5. So today, I'm going to try to break down some of the most useful ones. Now, I realize it may seem overwhelming as I said throwing all these elements at you. You're not supposed to memorize them all by the end of this lecture. Instead, I'm really just trying to give you a taste for what's out there so you can start playing with your own code.
            </p>
            So, one of the first things you need to decide when you're coding is, which tags are you going to use? There are the generic kind of what we call block tags, paragraph and div, that break your code into nice sections. Paragraph is kind of self-explanatory, and div gives you a way to put groups of content together. But the problem with both div and paragraph is that they're very generic. So we want to move over to the idea of using these semantic tags, such as header and nav, footer and figure. And we talked about those in an earlier video.
